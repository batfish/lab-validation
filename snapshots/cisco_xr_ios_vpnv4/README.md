The lab consists of 9 devices of interest, 5 providing the MPLS core and 4 acting as the CE devices where we can validate route exchange.

The lab focuses on MPLS VPN with LDP for MPLS label exchange and MP-BGP with vpnv4 unicast address family.

The core devices are PE1, PE2, PE3, RR1, and RR2 which are all IOS-XR devices.

CE1, CE2, CE3, and CE4 are Cisco IOS devices that act as CE devices in a classic MPLS VPN setup. They have no MPLS related configuration.
